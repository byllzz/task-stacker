# What I Learned From This Project

This project helped me understand how real frontend apps are built from scratch. Key learnings include:

- DOM manipulation with JavaScript
- Managing application state without frameworks
- Writing clean and reusable code
- Handling user input and UI updates
- Basic UI/UX principles for productivity apps
- Structuring a real frontend project properly

This was my first experience building a complete project instead of small practice components.

# How I Built This Project

1. Designed the layout and task flow on paper
2. Built the UI using HTML and CSS
3. Implemented all logic using vanilla JavaScript
4. Added dynamic task creation, deletion, and updates
5. Improved responsiveness for mobile and desktop
6. Tested edge cases like empty inputs and repeated actions

# Challenges I Faced

- Managing task state without using any framework
- Updating the UI dynamically after every action
- Preventing duplicate or empty tasks
- Keeping the code clean as features increased
- Making the layout responsive without breaking design

Each challenge helped me understand how real applications behave under user interaction.
